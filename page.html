		<h4> About Us</h4></u>
	<p><b>A story that matters
We believe that we’re only as good as the good we do.
All the facts and figures that talk to our size and diversity and years of history, as notable and important as they may be, are secondary to the truest measure of Deloitte: the impact we make in the world.
So, when people ask, “what’s different about Deloitte?” the answer resides in the many specific examples of where we have helped Deloitte member firm clients, our people, and sections of society to achieve remarkable goals, 
solve complex problems or make meaningful progress. Deeper still, it’s in the beliefs, behaviors and fundamental sense of 
purpose that underpin all that we do.</b></p><br><br>
